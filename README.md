# ink2raster
Extension for Inkscape to convert an 8-Bit BW picture to gcode for laser plotter.
Plotter used is a 15Watt grbl 1.1 laser.

Copy all files into the Inkscape extension folder. Under Ubuntu for example ~/.config/inkscape/extensions

# Tested with 15W China Laser, grbl 1.1, arduino nano
# 1) Create 8-Bit BW PNG picture file
# 2) Import into Inkscape
# 3) Extension -> Inkraster2Gcode
# 4) Set params
# 5) Create PNG preview and gcode file
#
# Needs: png.py
#
# Operation;
# The orig PNG file is transformed by inkscape to wanted size and then
# read back by png.py into workking matrix.
# Matrix X-row is laser scan- and burnline
# The gcode file uses a general speed set and varies the burn intensity
# by {S} param. This is needed because when using M4 and M5 the movement
# is shattering due the acceleration and decelration from burn px to burn px.
